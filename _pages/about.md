Welcome to My Website!
======
I am Aref Farhadipour, a PhD student at the University of Zurich, where I am set to begin my research on multimodal human-machine interaction in March 2024. My academic and professional journey has been deeply rooted in speech processing, multimodal signal processing, and artificial intelligence. With a background in electrical and sound engineering, my work has focused on developing AI-based solutions to tackle complex problems, particularly in speech and image processing.

My interests span a variety of fields, including music signal processing, speech processing, and multimodal data analysis. I am exploring how these modalities can be integrated to improve human-computer interaction. By combining voice, gesture, text, and facial recognition, I aim to contribute to more natural and intuitive ways for machines and humans to communicate.

This platform will be a space to share my research, publications, projects and interests. I would like you to explore my work. Contact me if you want to collaborate or learn more about my research.
